# The Living Lands
With each step upon the dry gravel road. The world seems to shake around you. With this you know. you have entered The Living Lands.

You are a Knight of the Realm, sworn to seek out the myths that plague the land and put them to rest with steel and flame.

What is your name - and what myths will you find?

### What is this really?

Living Lands is my intepretation of TTRPG Mythic Bastionlands into a digital environment, where npcs, myths, and more is "played" by AI. Can you outwit it?
